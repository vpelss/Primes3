# Primes3

Generates prime numbers by dividing and testing the next candidate number by all the previously found primes. This reduces the used array space compared to the the Sieve method which stores all the non prime numbers. Note how much longer this takes to run. The prime numbers are very sparce, so to get a large number of prime numbers we need to divide larger numbers by an ever growing array of prime numbers.
